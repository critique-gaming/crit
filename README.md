# Crit - Building blocks for Defold games

A battle-tested collection of un-opinionated modules we use at [Critique Gaming]
to make games with [Defold].

The modules are self-contained and depend on each other as little as possible,
each designed to solve one specific problem. Use as much or as little as you need.
